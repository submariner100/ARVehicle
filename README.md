# ARVehicle
ARKit - Small application that controls a vehicle on an horizontal plane.
This was quite an interesting project where a vehicle was made in SceneView out of primitive shapes, this was then placed on 
an horizontal plane. Controls were given to it where the user could steer the vehicle around in his own environments.
On the first commit the vehicle was built and the framework for configuration for ARKit was set up. The horizontal plane was detected
and the vehicle was then coded so that its wheels turn whenever the user turn his iPhone using Accelerometer.
