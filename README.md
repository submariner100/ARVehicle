# ARVehicle
ARKit - Small application that controls a vehicle on an horizontal plane.
Third Commit - added motion to the vehicle and mass by using the touchesBegin() and touchesEnded(). The applyEngineForce was 
applied to the vehicle so the user can now steer the vehicle by orientating his iPhone left of right in landscape mode. The user 
can move the vehicle on the horizontal plane by touching the screen.
